//we split “Hello World” into two alerts:
alert('Hello'); alert('World');

//statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:
alert('Hello');
alert('World');

//A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.
//This would also work:

alert('Hello')
alert('World')

//There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:
alert(3 +
1
+ 2);
